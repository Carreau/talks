# PLoS talk. 

This is the talk I gave at PLoS in SF on February 11th, 2016. 


### Jupyter, from data gathering to publications.

The Jupyter project, mainly known for the notebook, is a set of tools that cover
interactive computing from data gathering to publication. The notebook is not
only useful as a programming environment, but also integrate with more
and more platforms. Many tools are available which streamline and the publication process, 
and bring interactivity and control to the reader. We will explore a bit
how the notebook can be use for journalistic purpose. We will look also at
how various people and organisations use the notebook, which tools are developed around it, and what
are the next development step in the Jupyter ecosystem.
