<!--Hello there, I'm Matthias, I'm really happy to be here tonight  and speak with you. Huge thanks to Sylvain and Sebastien for organising and EDF for having us here tonight. It's going to be tough to deliver a talk at the level of Emanuelle. As you can HEAR I am French, and to be honest right now my brain does not know which language to speak so if I go too fast, or start speaking French, don't hesitate to interrupt me. -->

<!-- That's also apply if you have questions (if we are not recorded) otherwise let's try to keep the questions for the end. I'm happy to have this talk be more interactive. -->


## A bit of history

<!-- So circa 2011, I was doing a PhD, Here in paris 11th, at Institut Curie and had to deal with experimental data. While most of the lab used matlab, I was more attracted to Python because of all the software ingeniering features it provided that matlab did not. And especially if you have data to **Explore**  one of the Key package to to that was IPython (reminder, at that time the notebook was not a thing, and the QtConsole was just released).-->

<!-- As a reminder for those of you who were not aware of IPython at that time, or just because 2011 was a long time ago; IPython was create in 2001 (By Fernando Perez) and Used to be only a Shell up until ~2011. Thanks to a Grant from Enthought, the Core of IPython was reworked to be be (optionally) two processes, and lead to what is now the QtConsole and the base of the Protocol that gave birth to the nottebooks-->

<!-- So here I go using IPython, and starting to fill-in bugs, and  send PRs. So by the start of My PhD I wa doing a LOT of PhD, a bit of IPython, and by the end – as any procrastinating Graduate student – a bit of PhD a LOT of IPython. I still graduated BTW. And hence -->

I've now been an IPython/Jupyter Developer for about 6 years.
(got commit right, helped create the Notebok, Jupyter, NbConvert, Nbviewer... )

<!-- There was one particularly important part in what I said earlier, which is not trivial, and is one of the key that makes IPython (and Python) a popular language : -->

Explore.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
<!-- You see if you look at the spectrum of what we can call "Programming", one one hand you have Elliot Alderson right (Mr Robot for those not following) that's the "Standard Sofware Engeniering", you are a point A, you know you want  (or are told) to go to point B, you know all that's in between, or have little to no chance to try quickly your program on existing data. That's mostly what "traditional" IDE are good for. Create medium to large projects with a known end goal, unit test...etc -->

<!-- On the other end of the spectrum you have exploratory programming. Programming is not an end-goal, it's a tool to explore data, it's there to empower the user at the keyboard to multiply their ability. The users have often extremely deep domain specific knowlege, which is required to work this problem, and may not know everythong about Time complexity or even API, and most often they need to see the result of step N to decide what step N+1 should be (or what step N-1) should have been. I like to think of this end as Your (or My) Grand Mother, you've shown her how to mail to you pictures she took,  to print pictures of Cat she found on the internet and she ends up printing cat images and take pictures of them to mail them to you. If it works its not dumb.  -->

<!-- IPython focus a lot on the exploratory part -->

I in IPython is for interactive and it's not lower case I

<!-- So let's have a look at some of the features of IPython -->


DEMO

<!--
  - classing out vs print ("Hello Paris")
  
    my_list = ["Hello"]
    my_list[0].<tab>
   
    can completer we have type inference.

    item.

Interactive first is where IPython/Jupyter starts to differentiate from "Classic" IDE

<!-- 
So now of course, this is only where we start the process of Interactive fist, let's opena a notebook (connected to the same Pytho  environement)
And explore a bit how we push interactivity.

## Things to come

Async All the things !

<!-- 
Unless you've been living under a rock, you may have heard about `async` and `await` (not be be confused with AsyncIO), while asyncio is one opinonated implemetation of an async library there are a couple of others, curio, and trio are 2 that take a radically different approach (and API), whic you can find a few (uvloop) which keep compatibility with asyncio but attempt to be faster. 



There are likely many of you in here that have more experience than me with async programming. I can't ... to be an expert. But let me give a quick metaphore of sync/vs async. 

Think about a restrant, with customers comming in and out (after paying of course), sitting at a table, reading the menu, ordering, eating... etc.

We'll try timagine this situation from a waiter perspective; in a perfect Synchronous world, were the next customer only arrives once the previous one has left you want to:

-->
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
An example:


  - greet() the customer
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
  - move() them to their table.  
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  - take_order() of their order.
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  - order_kitchen() the food from the chef, 
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  - bring_food() the order back...
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
  - bill() ...and tip
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
  - leave() customer out. 
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
  - clean() table.
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->

... and take the next customer in...
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" --></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
<!--
Now, if you have one customer at a time that's fine. But in a synchronous world you have to stay to your task. While the customer are reading the menu, or eating you have to stay with them...  which is less than optimal if you wish to have less than 1 waiter/table, you can use preemtive multi tasking `threads()`... but it might be quite impolite to leave while your customer is talking to you. Or cooperative scheduling, with explicit point "It's or to leave now. `await` and `async` are these, any async function says "during this function, I may (or may not) leave while you do not need me", the explicit points where the waiter may leave are `yields`, but that's not important for now. 

The importnat part is that once the customers have their menu, the waiter may greet another one, clean the table...
-->

```
greet()
move()
await take_order()
await order_kitchen()
bing_food()
await bill()
await leave()
clean()
```

The waiter is our event loop, and we feed tasks to it. 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Asyncio look like that:

```
import asyncio
import aiohttp
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
async def main():
    response = await aiohttp.get('https://api.github.com')
    return await response.json()
data = loop.run_until_complete(main())
data
```
```
{'authorizations_url': 'https://api.github.com/authorizations',
 'code_se
 ...
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## In the REPL

<!-- Now if you've forgotten an `await` after the return, you may be greated with `<generator object ClientResponse.json at 0x00000000>`, which you need to `loop.run_until_complete(...)` once more ... 

This is less than ideal as 1) you have a lot to type, 2) that's not what you'll end up with in your final code, and 3) the exact incantations depends on the IO library you use. Would it be great if you could: 

```
rsponse = await aiohttp.get('https://api.github.com')
await data.json()
```

And have the REPL take care of the rest ?

-->
```
In[1]: response = await aiohttp.get('https://api.github.com')
```


```
  File "<ipython-input-20-4170cb01b36e>", line 1
    response = await aiohttp.get('http://localhost:8888/api.contens')
                           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

:-( 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">


let's fix that ! Or at lest try quick overview:

- wrap code in `async def ___wrapper___()`
- Turn it to ast. 
  - rename function to be invalid identifier.
  - make sure the function returns its last expression/value
- compile it.
- Extract function code object
- Clone and change flags to not create a new local scope
- `exec()`it (return a coroutine)
- process the coroutine in the right loop.

response = await aiohttp.get('http://localhost:8888/api.contens')

# all the following is "simplified"

(and not finished, need to be reviewed, merged, beta-tested, and released)</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Wrap our code in async
  
```
from textwrap import dedent, indent
def _asyncify(code:str) -> str:
    """wrap code in async def definition.

    And setup a bit of context to run it later.
    """
    res = dedent("""
        async def ___wrapper___():

    return res

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## rewrite AST

```
import ast
from ast import Expr, Await, Return

def _ast_asyncify(cell):
    tree = ast.parse(_asyncify(cell))
    function_def = tree.body[0]
    function_def.name = 'async-def-wrapper'
    lastexpr = function_def.body[-3]
    if isinstance(lastexpr, (Expr, Await)):
        del function_def.body[-3]
        function_def.body[-1] = Return(lastexpr.value)
    ast.fix_missing_locations(tree)
    return tree
```</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Now we have:

```
def async-def-wrapper():   # not a valid Python identifier
    # new scope created
    import aiohttp
    response = await aiohttp.get('http://localhost:8888/api.contens')
    # update locals "dict".
    locals() 
    return response # return the last expression.
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## get he code from out async `__wrapper__` and compile it, get the code object

```
code_ast = _ast_asyncify(our_code)
async_wrapper_code = compile(code_ast, 'cell_name', 'exec')

g = {}
l = {}
exec(async_wrapper_code, g, l )
code_object = l['async-def-wrapper']
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

`Code_object` is now:
```
# new scope created
import aiohttp
response = await aiohttp.get('http://localhost:8888/api.contens')
# update locals "dict".
locals() 
return response # return the last expression.

No function !
